# Scheduling defaults for generated content
# Hugo behavior:
# - publishDate: Controls when page becomes visible (requires --buildFuture to preview)
# - date: Used for sorting and display, but doesn't affect visibility
# - buildFuture: false (production) = hides pages with future publishDate
# - buildFuture: true (development) = shows all pages regardless of publishDate
scheduling:
  # Base timestamp for scheduling (ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix for UTC)
  # 🧪 TEST PHASE 1: Start time for first 60 pages
  # Set to past date for immediate visibility in production
  # With 30min intervals: 60 pages will be published over ~30 hours
  start_timestamp: "2025-10-03T00:00:00Z"
  
  # Delay in minutes between each published page (0 = publish immediately)
  # 🧪 TEST PHASE 1: 30 minutes = 60 pages in 30 hours (~1.25 days)
  # PHASE 2: Keep same interval for remaining 640 pages
  # Total time: 700 pages × 30 min = 14.5 days
  publish_delay_minutes: 30
  
  # Offset in minutes between publishDate and date fields
  # Usually 0 (both fields get same timestamp)

  # Apply scheduling to articles (true = use delayed publishing)
  apply_to_articles: true
  
  # Apply scheduling to product pages
  # 🧪 TEST PHASE 1: true = enable scheduled publishing for testing
  # Keep true for PHASE 2 to continue gradual rollout

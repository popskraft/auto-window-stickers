    We’ve analyzed real-world usage and pricing for industrial wipes in the U.S. market, and the numbers show that switching to our **$69** rolls can lead to significant yearly savings. For example, a typical shop relying on rental towels might spend around **$0.10** per towel. If that same shop uses **60,000** towels a year, the cost can reach **$6,000** annually. By contrast, you’d need only about **57** rolls of our industrial wipes — each with **1,050** sheets — costing roughly **$3,933** in total. That simple switch could save you over **$2,000** a year, and depending on usage, many businesses see annual savings ranging from **$875** up to **$3,500**.

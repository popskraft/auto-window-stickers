# GitHub Actions Workflow for Scheduled Netlify Builds
# Purpose: Trigger Netlify rebuilds to publish Hugo content with future publishDate
#
# How it works:
# 1. Hugo by default excludes pages with future publishDate (buildFuture: false in production)
# 2. This workflow triggers daily rebuilds on Netlify
# 3. As time passes, pages with publishDate in the past become visible
# 4. This enables gradual content rollout without manual intervention
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Create a Build Hook in Netlify:
#    - Go to: Site settings > Build & deploy > Build hooks
#    - Click "Add build hook"
#    - Name: "Scheduled Build" (or any name)
#    - Branch: main (or your production branch)
#    - Copy the generated URL (e.g., https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/abc123...)
#
# 2. Add the Build Hook URL as a GitHub Secret:
#    - Go to: Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#    - Click "New repository secret"
#    - Name: NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL
#    - Value: Paste the build hook URL from step 1
#    - Click "Add secret"
#
# 3. Commit this file to your repository
#
# CRON Schedule Explanation:
# - "0 6 * * *" = Every day at 6:00 AM UTC (adjust timezone as needed)
# - Format: minute hour day month weekday
# - Use https://crontab.guru/ to customize the schedule
#
# Alternative schedules:
# - "0 */6 * * *"  = Every 6 hours
# - "0 0,12 * * *" = Twice daily at midnight and noon UTC
# - "0 6 * * 1-5"  = Weekdays only at 6 AM UTC

  - In many [[state]] dealerships, improvised or aging labels still sit in windows.
    Without a purpose‑built [[product]] to present [[keyword]] details, buyers scan
    glass and find half facts or fading ink. That look can make good inventory feel
    overlooked and push small doubts into bigger objections. Buyers should not have
    to guess at basics like price, features, or warranty terms.

      lot long enough to buy. Buyers should not have to guess at basics like price,

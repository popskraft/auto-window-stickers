        Yes. With a super-concentrated formula, it’s ideal for high-volume
        environments like fleet maintenance centers, factories, and auto repair
        shops. A small amount covers plenty of ground, helping you cut supply
        costs and reduce restock frequency.

        linked to harsh chemicals. You get heavy-duty performance without
        damaging skin or surfaces.

    - question: "Does the hand cleaner have any scent or artificial dyes?"

        prioritizing a comfortable environment.

        Walnut shells are biodegradable and less abrasive on skin compared to

        efficient all day long.

        Regularly training your team on proper washing techniques can further
        extend each bottle’s lifespan.

        a versatile product that meets the demands of varied professions

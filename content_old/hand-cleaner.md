        My husband loves this soap. He works on cars sometimes and his hands seemed to absorb the nasty oil and buildup. He would have to soak his hands when he used other soaps, but not with this one. I would definitely recommend.

        Been using this soap for years. I'm a diesel mechanic and so far it's the only soap I've found to actually clean your arms and hands without having to scrub 3 separate times. Doesn't dry out your skin either. I've tried other soaps because this is on the pricey side but at the end of the day it's worth every penny

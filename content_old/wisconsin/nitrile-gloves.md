  titleColored: "F.A.Q."
  questions:
    - question: "Why choose 8 mil nitrile gloves for Wisconsin auto shops?"
      answer: >-
        The 8 mil nitrile gloves are designed for heavy duty use in automotive environments common to Wisconsin. Their thick, puncture resistant material protects hands from sharp parts, oils, and chemicals. Unlike thinner options, these gloves offer lasting durability, reducing the need for frequent changes and lowering overall costs. Whether you manage a Milwaukee dealership or a rural service bay, they deliver consistent performance. With FDA, ASTM, and CE approvals, they also meet federal and state regulations. Wisconsin mechanics appreciate the balance of toughness and tactility, making these gloves ideal for brake service, engine repairs, and routine maintenance.
    - question: "How does shipping work for Wisconsin orders?"
      answer: >-
        We offer next day and two day shipping options across Wisconsin. When you place an order before 3 PM Central Time, we process it immediately from our nearest Wisconsin warehouse. You can choose standard or expedited delivery at checkout. Tracking information is provided by email so you know exactly when the gloves will arrive at your auto shop. For dealership clients in Madison, Kenosha, or Eau Claire, our local distribution network ensures prompt fulfillment. Bulk orders over 500 boxes may qualify for free expedited shipping, reducing downtime and ensuring your service center stays stocked.
    - question: "Are these gloves FDA, ASTM, and CE certified?"
      answer: >-
        Yes. All our nitrile gloves meet FDA, ASTM, and CE certification standards. FDA 510k approval ensures safe contact with skin and common automotive fluids, while ASTM tests certify puncture resistance and tensile strength. CE marking means compliance with European safety directives, an added quality assurance. These certifications demonstrate that our gloves are built to strict professional standards, offering Wisconsin mechanics reliable protection. Keeping your service center compliant not only safeguards your team’s health but also helps you meet insurance and industry requirements for dealership operations.
    - question: "Can I order bulk quantities for my Madison service center?"
      answer: >-
        Absolutely. You can order bulk quantities directly through our online portal or by phone. Simply select ‘bulk order’ and choose from case sizes of 10, 50, or 100 boxes. Each box contains 100 gloves. We maintain a dedicated inventory in Madison, so your service center can avoid stock outages. Bulk pricing delivers up to 50 percent savings compared to retail packs. For large dealerships in Green Bay or Appleton, we offer custom pricing tiers and account management. Contact our Wisconsin support team for volume quotes or to set up a standing purchase agreement.
    - question: "What sizes are available and how do I fit them?"
      answer: >-
        Our gloves come in four sizes: Medium, Large, XLarge, and XXLarge. To find your fit, measure the widest part of your palm with a tape, then match the measurement to our size chart available on the product page. A proper fit is crucial for comfort and safety—too tight may tear when stretching, too loose can reduce control. Wisconsin mechanics report the Large size fits most, but measure before ordering. If you need assistance, our customer support team can help you pick the right size for your team members.
    - question: "How do I dispose of gloves responsibly in Wisconsin?"
      answer: >-
        Proper disposal helps protect the environment and comply with Wisconsin waste guidelines. After use, remove gloves carefully to avoid skin contact, then dispose of them as industrial waste or in your facility’s general waste bin if not contaminated with hazardous fluids. For gloves exposed to brake cleaner or other chemicals, follow local hazmat disposal rules and consult your service center manager. Our eco friendly nitrile formulation also reduces landfill impact. Consider bundling used gloves in sealed bags before disposal to prevent leaks and maintain shop cleanliness.

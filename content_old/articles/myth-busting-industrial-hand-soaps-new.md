There are a great many myths surrounding industrial hand soaps. From 'tough cleaners always ruin skin' to 'do eco-friendly products really work?', there are plenty of misconceptions out there that might drive someone away from the right solution. Let's dispel these myths. [**Nutcracker Hand Cleaner**](/hand-cleaner/) stands as a prime example of how an industrial hand soap can be both effective and gentle in addition to supporting sustainability.

## Myth #1: Tough Hand Cleaners Always Damage Skin

There is this general belief that a tough hand cleaner will definitely be harsh on the skin. For many, if one has to remove stubborn grime, then one needs a product that gives up skin health to accomplish that. However, [**Nutcracker Hand Cleaner**](/hand-cleaner/) simply proves that fact to be utterly wrong.

**Nutcracker** is a formula with skin conditioners and emollients to help protect skin, even while tackling the toughest grime. The walnut shell scrubbers are all-natural, which means it's tough on dirt, skin-friendly, and won't produce the dryness or cracking of the skin as commonly found with traditional hand soaps. For those mechanics and automotive professionals, they can get clean hands for once without any risk of irritation. Win-win for performance and comfort.

## Myth #2: Eco-Friendly Products Aren't Effective

Perhaps one of the biggest ongoing myths regarding soaps used in industry is that eco-friendly products are just not as effective as those containing a large amount of chemicals. It is pretty simple to see where this mentality comes from because people generally seem to think that going green just makes something less capable. [**Nutcracker Hand Cleaner**](/hand-cleaner/) once again proves going green doesn't mean sacrificing quality.

**Nutcracker** uses biodegradable walnut shells for abrasion and, though natural, is incredibly effective in breaking down grease, oil, and grime. The concentrated formula of the product means every drop works hard to provide a clean that can rival-even more often outperform-conventional hand cleaners. Be it from an engine or industrial ink, the job gets done with **Nutcracker** and without harmful chemicals.

## Myth #3: All Industrial Hand Soaps Are Alike

It is easy to get into your head that all industrial hand soaps are created equal, but that is simply not the case. [**Nutcracker Hand Cleaner**](/hand-cleaner/) was specifically designed for the types of challenges that automotive and industrial environments throw at your hands, providing targeted performance where it matters most.

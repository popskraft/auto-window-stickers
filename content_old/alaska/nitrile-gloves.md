        These gloves are super strong, and I love the textured grip. I use them for everything from oil changes to cleaning the garage. They're thick enough that I don't have to worry about them ripping, yet I can still move my fingers easily. Great purchase for the price!

        I was used to 6-mil gloves before, but these 8-mil ones are on another level. They're thick enough to resist snags and punctures on sharp edges, but I can still do detailed tasks. True to size, too I got a Large, and they fit perfectly. Highly recommended for Alaska workers!

        These gloves are impressively tough for automotive work, though I wish they were even more durable. They hold up to most tasks, including handling brake cleaner. I sometimes experience minor tears when working in tight spaces, but overall, they perform better than most gloves.

        I'm impressed with how strong these gloves are. I've caught them on rough metal, and they didn't tear. They do make my hands sweat after a while, but that's expected with thicker gloves. Perfect for tough jobs in Alaska's shops.

        I used to rip gloves every few minutes working on cars, but these gloves fit snugly and hold up well. I did a full brake job without a single rip. These gloves finally offer me protection that lasts, even in Alaska's tough working conditions.

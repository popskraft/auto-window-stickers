  questions:

        Yes. They’re engineered for oils, coolants, solvents, and more. Whether
        you run a dealership or a local mechanic supply store, these universal
        pads cut the guesswork and streamline inventory.
    - question: "How often should I reorder if I use them regularly?"
      answer: >-
        Each case offers 200 pads, so reordering depends on spill frequency.
        High-volume shops may want extra stock on hand, especially for busy
        seasons or high-traffic service centers.
    - question: "Do these pads work for large leaks as well as small drips?"
      answer: >-
        Absolutely. Whether your shop is on the coast or inland in California,
        one pad can absorb up to 20 ounces of fluid. For bigger spills, simply
        use multiple pads to contain and soak it up fast.
    - question: "Is there a recommended disposal method after use?"
      answer: >-
        Follow local regulations for oil or chemical-laden waste. Many auto shops
        seal used pads in approved bins. Check with your waste management
        provider to ensure compliance and maintain a tidy operation.
    - question: "What sets these pads apart from basic cardboard or rags?"
      answer: >-
        They’re designed specifically for automotive environments. Unlike
        cardboard or rags, Industrial Absorbent Pads won’t tear or saturate
        prematurely, so you get reliable absorption without frequent
        replacements.
    - question: "How do I store them to ensure they stay effective?"
      answer: >-
        Keep them in their dispenser box, away from extreme heat or moisture.
        They require minimal space, so you can stash them near service bays for
        quick access, supporting a fast response to spills.

      answer: >-
        Yes. Each pad’s high-absorption design tackles spills in moments, so
        technicians can stay focused on repairs. Fewer lengthy cleanups means
        increased productivity, translating to lower operational expenses.
